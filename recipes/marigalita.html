    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        The Margarita is one of the most popular cocktails in North America—for good reason. 
        Combining the tang of lime and the sweetness of orange liqueur with the distinctive strength of tequila, 
        the classic Margarita strikes all of the right keys. What’s less certain, however, is the drink’s origin.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some say the cocktail was invented in 1948 in Acapulco, Mexico, when a Dallas socialite combined blanco 
        tequila with Cointreau and lime juice for her guests. Others say that the Margarita, which translates to 
        daisy flower in Spanish, was an inevitable twist on the Daisy, a cocktail template involving spirit, citrus, 
        orange liqueur and soda. Make one with tequila, leave out the soda, and you get a Margarita. But regardless of 
        how or when it was invented, the Margarita has earned its way into drinkers’ hearts.
