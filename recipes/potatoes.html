    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        Potatoes are thought to have been independently domesticated several times and were 
        largely cultivated in South America by the Incas as early as 1,800 years ago. Encountered by 
        the invading Spaniards, potatoes were introduced into Europe during the second half of the 16th century. 
        By the end of the 17th century the plant was a major crop in Ireland, and by the end of the 18th century 
        it was a major crop in continental Europe, particularly Germany, and in the west of England. It continued 
        to spread, in both Western and Eastern hemispheres, during the first four decades of the 19th century, 
        and the Irish economy itself became dependent upon the potato. However, the disastrous failures of 
        the Irish crops in the mid-19th century (especially in 1846 and 1848), because of late 
        blight (Phytophthora infestans), and the resulting Irish Potato Famine generated a 
        more-cautious attitude toward dependence on the plant.
